# FC1-Monza
As F1 pulls up to the Italian Grand Prix, the Minecraft Ice Boat Racing series follows! This is a recreation of the circuit Monza with various fantasy elements to make for a good ice boat racing map.

Big thanks to Gabz for creating the basis of this map!
Go check him out on reddit ([u/Gabzs_][reddit-gabzs])! He's made a bunch of other high quality tracks.
